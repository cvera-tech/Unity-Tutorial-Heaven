## Notes

As opposed to the [Game Kit Intro course](../unity_3d_video_game_kit_introduction), this one has some actual C# programming. As of the time of this writing, I have been writing code for over a decade, and I first cut my teeth on C# back in 2019 (four years ago ðŸ˜²), so I can't really comment on how effective the material is at teaching complete beginners to programming. I will say, though, that the course is highly engaging. When I first started out, all I had was a copy of *HTML, XHTML, and CSS For Dummies*, the family laptop that we got from Circuit City, and vague web developer aspirations. Sure, I learned a lot, and my Neopets page looked spiffy, but it wasn't as fun as making a little pixel snowboarder faceplant after breaking the sound barrier doing backflips.

The course is split into multiple sections, each with a different project to complete. The projects all build upon knowledge and skills learned from previous projects.

Also, this course was updated some time ago to use Unity 2021.1. I used the latest LTS release available to me (2022.3.7f1), and I haven't noticed any significant changes, unlike the Game Kit Intro course.

## Projects

### 1. [Section 2: Delivery Driver](Section_2)

This is a top-down driving game where the player controls a car that delivers packages to customers. It's about as simple as games go, but the course managed to cover a lot of ground, including variables and variable types, methods, boolean logic, and if statements. As for the Unity-specific topics, the course covered Transforms, Colliders/Triggers, RigidBodies, and basic asset management.

Overall, I think this was a nice first project. It covers a lot of ground, and the resulting game is fun and has many opportunites for future improvements.

### 2. [Section 3: Snow Boarder](Section_3)

This is a side-scrolling action game where the player controls a snow boarder moving down a sloped terrain. At first, I thought that this would be a tricky project; I had some experience making a 2D platformer in Unity before where I remember running into some trouble with how the physics engine handled slopes. It turns out that Unity's surface effectors provide an easy (if unrealistic) way to have things slide around.

### 3. [Section 4: Quiz Master](Section_4)

This is a quiz game, plain and simple; however, creating it was anything but, mostly because my own prior experience in software development got the better of me.

This project introduces user interface development in Unity. We get to play with TextMeshPro, canvases, buttons, and images. All of that is great! UI is a critical part of games. The part of the project that I struggled with was the game architecture.

The instructor (Gary Pettie) wrote the game in a way where each game system was tightly coupled with several other systems. I tried to overlook this since this is a small game meant primarily to teach game programming basics, but at some point the little brain itch became too bothersome to ignore. I rewrote significant parts of the project to introduce a finite state machine.

I'm not entirely happy with the solution I came up with, but after spending several hours trying and failing to rearchitect the game to use a ScriptableObject-based game event system, I settled for what I had. On the plus side, I learned much about how to work with Unity's script lifecycle and about some neat features in C# that were added in the time since I last used it (like the `new()` instantiation shorthand, and `switch` expressions).
